Rank Ordering,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Number Yes is decreasing as Problity is also decreasing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) Bad Rate = Num of Yes / Total Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Top Decile people will give you 93 percent response,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KS gives us maximum separation between 0s and 1s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Note,,,,,Checks,,,,,,,,
Bad Rate should be in decreasing order with decreasing probablity,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KS should be almost similar between train and test,,,,,,,,,,,,,
%1 should be similar between train and test,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KS value should come in top-5 deciles,,,,,,,,,,,,,
